# CookBook -- Jacob Frensley's NSS Backend Capstone

## Introduction
This full stack project was my way of showcasing everything I have learned during my time at Nashville Software School. From JavaScript and React to C# using .NET, this is my full stack application for people who love cooking new recipes!

## Purpose & Motivation
The purpose of this final capstone is to display all the things I have learned about in NSS, and just like my front end capstone I chose a subject that is a hobby of mine and something I care about. I enjoy cooking and finding new recipes, so my inspiration was a social media site specifically dedicated to people sharing their recipe ideas.

## How does this application work?
I used the React library, as well as ReactStrap, to create the client side of the application and C# using the .NET framework to create the server side of the application. Users are able to create, read, update, and delete data in the client by accessing the database through various Http requests that my server side controllers and repositories handle.

## How to install and run
Steps to run my project, after having cloned this repo from GitHub:
1. Run both of the SQL setup scripts found in the SQL directory, setup before seed data
2. Run the server through visual studios
3. Run 'npm start' in the client directory
4. Log in as a pre existing user in the database

## Difficulties and challenges experienced while making this app
During the sprint to reach MVP for this capstone, I found that the greatest challenge to overcome was working alone instead of in a group like my previous NSS full stack projects. Time management was crucial, as was organization to make sure my capstone stayed on track and in focus. As for the code itself, I wanted to challenge myself by using React and some properties of React that I didn't use too much during the first three months of NSS. In the end, I found it satisfying to finally connect my front end client to my back end server and have it do exactly what I inteded it to do.
